    "description1": "I'm a self-taught developer who loves creating and learning new things. I've been coding since I was 9, exploring different technologies and projects along the way. My curiosity drives me to experiment, tackle challenges, and find creative solutions. Over time, I've built a versatile skill set and a real appreciation for clean, practical code. I'm always excited to try new projects and keep learning.",
    "description2": "In my free time, I enjoy watching motorsport competitions, especially Formula 1 and Formula E. The competitiveness and high-speed action inspire me to push my own limits.",

    "planningDescription": "Every task begins with an idea, but an idea without a plan is just a wish. So I start every project by understanding what I want to achieve, what tools should be used. And sometimes if necessary, I create concepts to visualize the end result.",

      "description": "My attempt at game development - a puzzle game where you try to beat me at my own challenges!",
      "longDescription": "This was such a fun project to work on! I wanted to create a game that would challenge the player while also showing off some of the programming concepts I've learned. Players have to go through different parcours challenges with different skills to progress through levels."

      "title": "Health Hub website with API integration",
      "description": "Built this to showcase my abilities in webdev - a health platform packed with useful tools powered by real APIs",
      "longDescription": "This was one of my more ambitious web projects! I wanted to create something actually useful, not just another todo app. It pulls data from various health APIs to give you air quality info, calculate your BMI, analyze food nutrition, look up drug information. The API integration was tricky but so satisfying when everything finally worked together."

      "title": "Project Euler Solutions with JavaScript",
      "description": "My try at solving as many Project Euler problems as I could.",
      "longDescription": "Project Euler gave me a great way to explore algorithms and problem-solving. Working through the problems helped me understand optimization, mathematical reasoning, and clever approaches to challenges. Each solution became a hands-on lesson in how algorithms work."

      "longDescription": "This was a fun challenge where I inherited a completely broken robotic car and had to figure out how to bring it back to life. Started from scratch with the Arduino programming, fixed the hardware connections, and somehow managed to get this thing driving around autonomously."

    "project5": {
      "title": "AI Video Generator",
      "description": "Built an AI video creation workflow using local models - because privacy matters and APIs are expensive!",
      "longDescription": "I got tired of paying for AI video generation services and wanted more control over my data, so I built my own solution. This uses n8n to orchestrate everything, LM Studio to run local AI models, and FFMPEG to stitch it all together into actual videos. It's a proof of concept that shows you don't always need to rely on external APIs - sometimes the DIY approach is more fun (and cheaper)!"

      "title": "University of Sherbrooke Health Hub",
      "description": "Another health platform I built - this time focused on nutrition, exercise, and wellness tips",
      "longDescription": "After building the first health hub, I wanted to try a different approach focused more on daily wellness. This one is all about helping people make better choices with personalized nutrition advice, exercise tracking with calorie calculations, and practical wellness tips. I really enjoyed working on the user experience - trying to make health information actually accessible and not overwhelming."

      "title": "Social Media App Design + Prototype",
      "description": "Designed a social media app concept and built a working prototype to test my ideas",
      "longDescription": "I had this idea for a different kind of social media app and wanted to see if I could bring it to life. Started with wireframes and user flows in Figma, then built a working prototype in React Native to test the concept. The design process was fascinating - trying to balance user engagement with actually healthy social interactions. You can check out both the design files and a demo video of the prototype in action."
